#1. Read the News in my Launcher, Press Reset (the program should change its name).
#2. Run my Program as ADMIN again, select functionality and press START! In the window "you can play" click OK.
#3. Run the game and check that the mouse and keyboard are hanging, then you can play (the very first time can be long).
#4. Launch an online raid, the character should become colored.
 
P.s. Spoofer is needed only if you have a hardware lock and it works completely until the computer is restarted. After restarting the computer, you need to spoofer again and check the change in Mac and Hwid, you do not need to turn it on every start of the game).
